All Figures are made in the following notebooks, with corresponding figures denoted per notebook. Resistive shooting data is stored in Shooting-AlfvenSweep-Scaled-Data, specific NIMROD contours are in Contour-Data, and parameter scaling (kz, vorticity, etc) are stored in Scaling.

All data is attached in a ZIP format at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u0cFRrZPN2LYz-pZfE03plbmejLI8kXV/view?usp=sharing
